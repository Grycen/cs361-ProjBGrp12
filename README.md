Note on port #s:
I'm not sure what happens if we implemented this code and all used the same port # (probably nothing good!) So let's divide up port #s. Example (Feel free to change this...)

jacob 5000

Open item if someone wants to create this...
One way to solve this programmatically is to alter the server.js file to set port # value to a number that is local to your directory. Example everyone create a local file called "personal-port-number.txt" and it contains your personal port. then the server.js file reads the number from this text file. Need to add "personal-port-number.txt" to .gitignore file so that your local port # file doesn't get merged to main. (let me know if this doesn't make sense)
